The three datasets correspond to the full [Bottomly](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=21455293) dataset that is available on [ReCount](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/recount/), and two smaller datasets generated by randomly selecting samples from the full set. The full set contains data from two different mouse strains C57Bl and DBA, with 10 and 11 replicates, respectively. We created another dataset with 5 replicates for each strain (n = 10), and one with 2 replicates for each strain (n = 4). **How does the relationship between mean and variance change as you increase the number of replicates?**
